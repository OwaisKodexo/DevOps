CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network which mean its use to reduce the latency 
what is the meaning of latency 
for Example you have a website which server is in America and when your user request for your website it will definitely take time to return the content what content delivery network do is the cache the data in edge server for 24 hours (default time can be change) 
how CloudFront works 

When you create a distribution, CloudFront provides a domain name for it, such as d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net. Instead of using this provided domain name, you can use an alternate domain name 
but there are some requirement for Alternate Domain Name
-> 	All alternate domain names (CNAMEs) must be lowercase.
	
->	To add an alternate domain name (CNAME) to a CloudFront distribution, you must attach to your distribution a trusted, valid *SSL/TLS* certificate that covers the alternate domain
	name. This ensures that only people with access to your domain’s certificate can associate with CloudFront a CNAME related to your domain.
	
->	can use a self-signed certificate to validate an existing CNAME, but not for a new CNAME. CloudFront supports the same certificate authorities as Mozilla.

->	However, you can’t add alternate domain names that are at levels higher or lower than the wildcard. For example, you can’t add the alternate domain names example.com or
	marketing.product.example.com.
	
->	You want to add marketing.product.example.com as an alternate domain name. To do this, you can list *.product.example.com on the certificate, or you can list
	marketing.product.example.com itself on the certificate.

->	You cannot add an alternate domain name to a CloudFront distribution if the same alternate domain name already exists in another CloudFront distribution, even if your AWS account
	owns the other distribution.
