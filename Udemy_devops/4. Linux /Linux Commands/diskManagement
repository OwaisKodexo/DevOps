fdisk is use to manage partition 
primary partition should not be more than 4 partitions 
good practice is to keep one primary partition
dev is the directory where you can get the drivers information
to create a new partition 
sudo fdisk /dev/sdx (x ki jaga 'a' ho ga 'b' ho ga)(to create a partition)
n (to create a new partition)
p (for primary)
1 (partition number 1)
w (to save the above) 
partprobe (aksar disk ap ko nazar nahi aati hai to ap is command se dekh sakte hain)
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt (maybe it will give an error to solve this)
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1 (to create a file system like in window we format in fat & ntfs partition)
reboot the machine (but reboot k bad mount disk available nh ho gi) to is k lye apko batana parega file system me k jab reboot ho k aao to is partition ko yaha p map krna hai aur jab bhi is partition ko long term rkhna hai to ham yeah kam krege. 
nano /etc/fstab (fstab = filesystem table)

/dev/sdb1 /mnt ext4 defaults 0 0 (first column is partition path, press tab, where you want to mount it than format type defaults for option 0 mean no dump code and 0 no fsc *file system check* code)
mount -a (it will mount the all the entries from fstab file )

lsblk (susbtitute of fdisk *list block device*)
