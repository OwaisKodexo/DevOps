linux me ek user lazmi hota hai or woh woh hota hai jo create krta hai mtlb installation k time me ek user create ho jata hai.
umask (user file-creation mode mask) its also a command 
There are three types of user in linux 
owner 
Group
others 
chmod = change mod to change the permission(read, write and execute) + is for enable and - is for disable 
u+x (given the execution permiss	ion to the user)
g-w (disable the write permission for group)
o+r (enable the read permission for others)

to change ownership we use
chown <newOwner> <filename>
chgrp <groupName> <fileName>
chown <newOwner>:<NewGroup> <filename> to change both through one command
chown -R (to change the subdirectories ownership)

*********************************************************************************************
TO add/del the user 
cat /etc/passwd (this directory contain all the user list)
cat /etc/group (this directory contain all the group list) 
when new user created he get (name, id , group, gid, homeDir, /bin/bash *one shell*)
sudo useradd (*low-level command* will not create a home directory, if you want to create use -m with command)
sudo adduser (High level command interactive and create home directory) 
sudo groupadd <groupName>
sudo passwd (to set the password for the user)
passwd <userName> (if want to give password to existing user)
sudo adduser owais (owais has been added in user)

*Additional Information*
there are two types of user or accounts (system and custom accounts *above 1000 are custom accounts) 
Theoretically we can add upto 4 billion user 
but the default range is 1000 to 60,000 
0 to 999 are fixed for system (in some distribution it can be upto 500) but mostly 1000 are fixed for system 


sudo userdel (to delete the user but the home directory will not be deleted)
sudo deluser (deluser, delgroup - remove a user or group from the system)
sudo userdel -r (to del the home directory)
sudo groupdel (to delete from the group)
sudo delgroup 

groupmod
usermod -l new_username old_username: Changes the user's login name.
usermod -aG groupname username: Adds the user to an additional group.
usermod -d /new/home/dir username: Changes the user's home directory.
usermod -s /bin/bash <userName> to change the shell 
usermod -L <username> to lock the user *you cannot login to this user*
