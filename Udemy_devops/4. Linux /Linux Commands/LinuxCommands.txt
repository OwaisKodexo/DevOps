cat /etc/apt/source.list
cat /etc/apt/source.list.d
apt list | wc -l (word count list)
du -sh (disk usage -s summarize -h = human readable form) 
find / -type d -name vprofile-project (to find any missing directory in my case vprofile-project is the directory)
echo -e "\e[1mThis is the bold text\e[0m" (to bold the text)
ps -elf (to see the process )
kill -l (to list all the signal)
to export variables and if you want to add alias for everyone 
vi /etc/profile  
vi /etc/bash.bashrc (both work same)

and if you want to add alias or export variable for the user 
vi ~/.profile (logout once so bash take the file from this )
vi ~/.bashrc (both work same )
source ~/.profile


ssh-keygen (to generate a key)
ssh-copy-id <userName>@<hostname> 
private key will be longer and public key will be shorter
