1. CUSTOM USER AND HOME DIRECTORY SETUP 

In response to heightened security concerns, the Kodexo security team has opted for custom Apache users for their web applications. Each user is tailored specifically for an application, enhancing security measures. Your task is to create a custom Apache user according to the outlined specifications:
a. Create a user named JOHN 
b. Assign a unique UID 1206 and designate the home directory as /var/www/john. 

***********************************************************************************************************************************
2. GROUP CREATION AND USER ASSIGNMENT
The system admin team at Kodexo Industries has streamlined access management by implementing group-based access control. Here's what you need to do:

a. Create a group named Dev_Team across 3 virtual machine 

b. Add the user mohammed into the Dev_Team group on all virtual machine. If the user doesn't exist, create it as well.

***********************************************************************************************************************************
3. SECURE ROOT SSH ACCESS  

Following security audits, security team has rolled out new protocols, including the restriction of direct root SSH login.
Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the Stratos Datacenter.
***********************************************************************************************************************************
4. USER DATA TRANSFER

Due to an accidental data mix-up, user data was unintentionally mingled at the /home/usersdata location by the Kodexo production support team in PC. To rectify this, specific user data needs to be filtered and relocated. Here are the details:
Locate all files (excluding directories) owned by user talha within the /home/usersdata directory on (Directory). Copy these files while preserving the directory structure to the /ecommerce directory.

5. FILE PERMISSION CORRECTION

After conducting a security audit within the Kodexolabs, the Kodexo security team discovered misconfigured permissions on critical files. To address this, corrective actions are being taken by the production support team. Specifically, the file named /etc/hostname on <server> requires adjustments to its Access Control Lists (ACLs) as follows:
1. The file's user owner and group owner should be set to root.
2. Others should possess read only permissions on the file.
3. User Dayyan must not have any permissions on the file.
4. User Usman-QA should be granted read only permission on the file.

***********************************************************************************************************************************
6.CREATE USER WITH NON-INTERACTIVE SHELL

***********************************************************************************************************************************
7. String Replacement
Your task is to substitute all occurrences of the string "Sample" with "Cloud" within the XML file located at /root/nautilus.xml on the backup server.

***********************************************************************************************************************************
File Transfer
8. A Kodexo developer has stored confidential data on the jump host within Stratos DC. To ensure security and compliance, this data must be transferred to one of the vagrant virtual machine. Given developers lack direct access to these servers, the system admin team has been enlisted for assistance.



Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 1 placing it in the directory /home/nfsshare.



***********************************************************************************************************************************

In alignment with security compliance standards, the Nautilus project team has opted to impose restrictions on crontab access. Specifically, only designated users will be permitted to create or update cron jobs.

Configure crontab access on App Server 3 as follows: Allow crontab access to mark user while denying access to the jerome user.


*********************************************************************************************************************************

Synchronize the timezone settings to match the local datacenter's timezone (Pacific/Easter).
