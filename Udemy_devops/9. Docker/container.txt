Why we use container instead of Virtual machine 
Container is like a miniature operating system (mini os). Its a light weight. Containers start up in seconds because they donâ€™t need to boot up a full OS. it do not need a full OS for each instance. 
This leads to faster startup times and reduced resource usage.
VMs require a full OS for each instance, which means they are heavier and consume more resources (memory, storage, CPU).
Containers are well-suited for microservices architectures where applications are broken down into smaller, independently deployable services. They can be easily scaled up or down to meet demand.
Containers provide process-level isolation, while VMS are use when we need strict isolation.
