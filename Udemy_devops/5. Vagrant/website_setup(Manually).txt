we want to setup a website on centOS for this we o we sue ready-made template download it from the internet. . 
tooplate.com (Website for donwloading template)
vagrant global-status 
if have any previous instance delete it . . 
vagrant init with the box name in our case centos 9 
configure the vagrant file 
uncomment 
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.22"
config.vm.network "public_network" (if this line is commented you cannot see the website on browser)
vagrant up 
vagrant ssh 
sudo su (siwtch to root user)
nano /etc/hostname 
hostname (whatever you want to name the host) not mandatory logout and login again 
yum (yum is like apt we use in centOS) install httpd (its the website package) wget (from this we going to donwload the html template) vim (text editor)  unzip zip -y (yes to all commands)
systemctl start httpd 
systemctl enable httpd 
ip addr show (to check the ip address) 

now to add the content in the website 
~# cd /var/www/html
create a file in this folder
nano index.html (create the file with the same name which we throw on the browser)
systemctl restart httpd (or reload the service)

now because we are downloading it from the tooplate so we download it in a temporary folder 
cd /tmp/
wget download link 
if in a zip form uzip it 
go to the uzip folder 
check all the content from ls command 
cp -r* (we copy all the content of the folder * mean all the content in the folder) /var/www/html/
ls /var/www/html 
restart httpd service 
systemctl status httpd 
also check the firewall service
systemctl status firewalld (if its running we have to stop it)
