there is a difference between jdk and jre 

JRE it is used to run java based application

JDK java development kit to develop java application 

we are going to build java application form the source code. . for this we need JDK

cd /src/main/resources/ (remember this path throughout the course)


we have application.properties file in the above mentioned folder 
in this file we have db01:3306 (default port for mysql service)

in the folder vprofile-project 
we see the pom.xml 
and run mvn install (this is going to take some time to build the application because its going to read the source code and built the artifact (Artifact is a deployable product))
Artifact is basically an archive 
archive in java is war, jar, ear like we have zip, tar 


we have to remove the default application /usr/local/tomcat/webapps in this directory 
with the name ROOT . . to deploy our artifact we have to remove this.. 

cp target/vprofile-v2.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war if we don't copy with the root name its not be going to be the default application. it will be an application but its name will be vprofile not default . .
